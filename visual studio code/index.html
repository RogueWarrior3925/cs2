    <h1>This is my dream place</h1>
    <h2>it is the kirby cafe</h2>
    <h2>In the world of Nintendo, Kirby may not be as legendary as Mario Brothers; nor is Kirby as cute or popular as Pikachu. But when it comes to character cafes, Kirby Cafe Tokyo has won both my heart and my stomach. My heart fell not only for how delicately cute the decor is, but also for the exquisitely crafted character faces that infiltrated the dishes. And to my pleasant surprise, almost every dish that we ordered, from appetizer through main course to dessert, actually tasted quite delicious. The latter is something that Kirby Cafe Tokyo outdoes Pok√©mon Cafe Tokyo for me personal</h2>
