    <h1>This is my dream place</h1>
    <h2>it is the kirby cafe</h2>
    <h2>In the world of Nintendo, Kirby may not be as legendary as Mario Brothers; nor is Kirby as cute or popular as Pikachu. But when it comes to character cafes, Kirby Cafe Tokyo has caught my interest. I  loved the how delicately cute the decor is, but also for the exquisitely crafted character faces that infiltrated the dishes. </h2>
